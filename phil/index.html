	<h2>Endorsements</h2>
	
	<p>These are services that I use and enjoy. I feel strongly enough about them to share them with you, plus, some of these links are affiliate links, which means you will get something extra and I might too. Even so, I would not endorse them if I did not use then and feel that they provide great value and service.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://db.tt/wevYq9H">Dropbox</a>
			- Cloud storage that you can get to from almost anywhere. 2GB of storage for free. Similar to Google Drive, so if you have that you might not have any use for Dropbox. (Affiliate: You and I each get 500MB extra, for free, forever.) With iCloud Drive coming in the fall I might use that instead of Dropbox since I am totally emersed in the Apple ecosystem.</li>

		<li><a href="https://lastpass.com/f?3204376">LastPass</a>
			- Use strong passwords and store them securely. Basic service if free. I use premium to support them and use the mobile apps. If you are not using a password manager then you are not using strong, unique passwords. LastPass can help. (Affiliate: we each get one month free of premium.)</li>

		<li><a href="http://kiva.org/i/iSdfcY1BhIk">Kiva</a>
			- Micro lending. Loan small amounts of money to really change lives. (Affiliate: We get to feel good about the world and we each get a free $25 loan.)</li>

		<li><a href="https://hover.com/pobQJ25G">Hover</a>
			- Register domains made easy. No up-sell. Provide registration, forwarding, and DNS for a very reasonable cost. (Affiliate: You get a $2 discount and I get a $2 credit.)</li>

		<li><a href="https://www.lynda.com">Lynda.com</a>
			- video training library. Lots of design stuff but also a fair about of development. Also, business and photography too. (Not an affiliate link.)</li>

		<li><a href="https://learnable.com">Learnable</a>
			- a smaller video training site that speciallizes in web development. It also includes access to books from Sitepoint. (Not an affiliate link.)</li>
	</ul>
